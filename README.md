# 🧠 Disease Prediction from Medical Data

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diseases based on patient medical records including symptoms and history. The model is trained on labeled datasets and classifies patient data to assist in early diagnosis and healthcare decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts potential diseases using user input features
- Trained on a structured medical dataset
- Uses classification algorithms for accurate prediction
- Can be easily deployed and extended for real-world applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **scikit-learn** – machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas / NumPy** – data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization (optional)
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – development

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Synthetic or public medical dataset with fields like:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Symptoms
  - Patient history
  - Diagnosis (label)

You can use datasets from:
- [Kaggle Medical Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Or generate synthetic data for testing
