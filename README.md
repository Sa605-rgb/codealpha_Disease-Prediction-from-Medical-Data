# codealpha_Disease-Prediction-from-Medical-Data
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a disease based on medical data such as symptoms and patient history. Using classification algorithms, the model analyzes labeled medical records to determine potential diagnoses. This can assist in early detection and support healthcare decision-making.
